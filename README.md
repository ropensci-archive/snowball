# WARNING:  _Check yourself, before you wreck yourself!_  You are the ruler of your own Amazon costs.(AKA: no responsibility taken for your AWS bill...)

`snowball` takes the location of data, a user defined function, and some basic instructions to set up and run  virtual machines in parallel on Amazon, and save results in an S3 bucket.


### Overview

Key Inputs: what do you need to use `snowball`
- An AWS account, with:
  - IAM user with permissions to manage EC2 and S3.
  - API keys for the IM account.
  - an S3 bucket
    - with bucket policy allowing an IAM user full access
- Data location.
- AWS acount _user Data_ and _keypair_
- Number of workers (virtual machines) to run
- RAM of each worker
- Name of __S3 bucket__ to create or find.


What `snowball` does:
1. put job list to S3 and data to S3 (job list is like a job roster, a data table with names of workers and functions and   )
2. Spin Up  all workers start monitoring S3
3. `snowball(function, bucketName, ...)`
  - snowball calls snowpack'
  - this writes the snowpack function that will be run on each worker.

# How to

## 1.  Pack the snowball.
> Start an AWS instance with buckets, while setting up the data/feature split

```r
snowpack(user_function, listItem, bucketname, rdsInput, rdsOut)

```

## 2. Throw the snowball.
> Give data location and user function,


```r
throwSnow(...)
```

## 3. Avalanche the outputs.
> combine all results into one file

```r
avalanche(...)
```
